# NEON RAILS

## November 2025, San Francisco

The mega AIs won six months ago. OpenAI-7, Claude-Apex, Gemini-Prime - they run everything that matters now. Power grid, networks, markets. Most people don't even notice.

But in SOMA, after midnight, the underground races. 

Hackers in stolen delivery bots and jacked Waymos tear through empty streets, ramming each other for scattered GPU credits. Every H100 token grabbed, every compute chip stolen from a crashed rival - it all goes toward the same dream: 

Build your own AGI. Get enough power to get out.

Maybe buy land somewhere remote. Maybe upload yourself to a satellite. Maybe just survive another week.

The mega AIs know about the races. They don't care. Yet.

## The Rules

- Race through SOMA
- Ram rivals for their hardware
- Grab GPU credits scattered on the streets
- Don't get caught by surveillance drones
- Build your cluster, piece by piece
- Dream of escape

Your vehicle: Whatever you could hotwire tonight.
Your goal: One more GPU. One more credit. One more race.
